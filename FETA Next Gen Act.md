- (a) There is established within the Office of the President a new body called the FETA Next Gen (FNG).

- (c) Profits gained from members' money in the CMU shall be split 50/50 between members proportional to their savings and the FETA group.
    
- (d) The CMU Treasurer shall take on the duties of the former FETA Treasury Treasurer, including providing spending plans.
    
- (e) The Office of the President is vested with spending decision authority unless purchases exceed [X%] of revenue, in which case House approval is required.
    
- (f) The FETA group shall stake any unused cash into the CMU. Any funds not planned for immediate use may be invested or staked in the CMU.
